VFR flight planning online. Open-source, non-commercial hobbyist project with a main focus on Switzerland.

The goal of this project is to show the possibilities of VFR flight planning in a modern web browser, integrating different data sources and using current web technologies and frameworks like HTML5, Javascript, AngularJS, Openlayers and Bootstrap. It's a personal, non-commercial project written out of passion for aviation and information technology in general.
